# Movie-finder
A scraper script to search for movies and find movie download links from my favorite movie website (avamovie).  As a result, I don't need to open the browser to find and download the movie!

TODO :
- [X] Add python rich
- [X] Make script for onyl movies
- [ ] Add time report for search
- [X] Fix spider man moveis bug
- [ ] Add pydantic to project
- [ ] Trying to handle receiving serial links
